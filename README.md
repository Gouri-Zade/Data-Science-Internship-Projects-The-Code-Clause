## Movie Recommendation System
### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a recommendation system that suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. The Movie Recommendation System utilizes content-based filtering, a popular approach in recommendation systems. The system analyzes large datasets to identify patterns and similarities between users and movies. 

### Key Features
* Data preprocessing and cleaning: The code includes data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency. This ensures that the recommendation system is built on reliable and accurate data.

* Details Extraction from Features to Transformation: The code contains the data extraction process from features and converts them to one feature for recommendations.
    
* Machine Learning algorithms: The project incorporates various machine learning algorithms, such as content-based filtering, to build the recommendation system. The algorithms are implemented using Python and popular libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.
